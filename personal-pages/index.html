    <!-- Start talking about my hobby -->
    <section>
        <h2>Favorite Video Game</h2>
        <p>
            Far Cry 5 is, in my opinion, one of the best video games out there. It has everything: An amazing story,
            engaging gameplay, and is fun. It's always nice to drive around listening to the goated soundtrack while
            blowing up cultists.<br><br>

            Ubisoft also had some extended support for the game by introducing Far Cry Arcade. An actual multiplayer
            system that wasn't just an afterthough like the original co-op in story mode was. Now the game is fun both
            casually <i>and</i> competitively.

        <h2>What About my Hobbies?</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Gaming -->
            When I play games, most of the time it's with other people. I usually play a lot of Rainbow Six Siege and
            Dead by Daylight. I have been branching out but if it's not a multiplayer game that I have in common with my
            friends I probably don't play it all too much. That doesn't mean I don't like it, just that I don't play it
            that often.<br><br>

            <!-- Drawing -->
            I'm not the best at sketching either, but I do enjoy it. I like making concept art for games, like this
            imagining of springtrap in Dead by Daylight.<br>
        <div align="center">
            <img src="springtrap-in-dbd.jpg" width="350" alt="a cats face within two burger buns"><br>
        </div>

        Drawing, coding, and gaming are the three hobbies that I want to majorly get better at.
