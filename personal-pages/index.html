        <h2>Favorite Video Game</h2>
        <p>
            Far Cry 5 is, in my opinion, one of the best video games out there. It has everything: An amazing story, engaging gameplay, and is fun. It's always nice to drive around listening to the goated soundtrack while blowing up cultists.<br><br>

            Ubisoft also had some extended support for the game by introducing Far Cry Arcade. An actual multiplayer system that wasn't just an afterthough like the original co-op in story mode was. Now the game is fun both casually <i>and</i> competitively.

        <h2>What About my Hobbies?</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Gaming -->
            When I play games, most of the time it's with other people. I usually play a lot of Rainbow Six Siege and Dead by Daylight. I have been branching out but if it's not a multiplayer game that I have in common with my friends I probably don't play it all too much. That doesn't mean I don't like it, just that I don't play it that often.<br><br>
            
            <!-- Drawing -->
            I'm not the best at sketching either, but I do enjoy it. I like making concept art for games, like this imagining of springtrap in Dead by Daylight.<br>
            <div align="center">
                <img src="springtrap-in-dbd.jpg" width="350" alt="a cats face within two burger buns"><br>
            </div>

            Drawing, coding, and gaming are the three hobbies that I want to majorly get better at.
